## üìü PMM API (Private Market Maker API)
The PMM API connects directly with professional market makers through a Request-For-Quote (RFQ) setup, ensuring 0% slippage and competitive pricing. This API allows platforms to execute trades with guaranteed prices, offering price certainty to users.

## üîÄ Router API
The Router API combines the benefits of both the PMM RFQ and JAM APIs, retrieving quotes from both systems and delivering the best price while factoring in gas fees. This ensures users capture the most favorable market price through Bebop‚Äôs infrastructure.
